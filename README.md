# weather-app

A weather app that searches for weather at a location using google geolocation api and openweathermap weather tracking api.

Initially based on lessons from the book "Learning Node.js Development" by Andrew Mead. Repository for book version found at
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-Node.js-Development/blob/master/Chapter07/weather-app/app-promise.js

I have added some of my own features, like reading api key information from a file, and plan on adding more.
